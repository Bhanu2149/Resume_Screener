## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ai-resume-screener.git
cd ai-resume-screener
For Frontend Development

Open the project in VS Code and start building UI inside the frontend folder.

Example:

cd frontend/hr
open dashboard.html


You can use Live Server extension in VS Code to preview your pages easily.

3. For Backend (later phase)
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

🌿 Git Workflow for Team Collaboration

Create new branch for each feature:

git checkout -b feature/hr-dashboard


Make changes → then add, commit, and push:

git add .
git commit -m "Added HR dashboard layout"
git push origin feature/hr-dashboard


Open a Pull Request (PR) → review → merge to main.

✨ Tips

Keep commits small and descriptive (e.g., "Added upload form + styled cards").

Use branches for each feature to avoid code conflicts.

Test pages using Live Server in VS Code.

Keep UI simple and responsive — mobile-friendly designs are a plus.
